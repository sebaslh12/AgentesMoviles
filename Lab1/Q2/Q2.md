# Abstract Class

An abstract class defines a class that can't be instantiated, the purpose of an abstract class is to function as base for the subclasses. An abstract class can have methods or abstract methods but if a class has an abstract method, the class must be declared as abstract. 

## Abstract Methods 

An abstract method has no implementation, so all the subclasses of the abstract class must implement(override) the abstract methods. The non abstract methods can be implemented (override) as well.

## Subclasses

The subclass that extends an abstract class must implement(override) all the non abstract methods and it can override the non abstract methods if is necessary.

### Abstract Class declaration
``` java 
public abstract class Moviles {
	public void nonAbstractMethod(){
		System.out.println("An Abstract class may have non-Abstract methods");
	}
	public abstract void abstractMethod();	
}
```

### Abstract Class instantiation
``` java 
public class AbstractInstance extends Moviles {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Moviles instance1 = new AbstractInstance();
		instance1.abstractMethod();
		instance1.nonAbstractMethod();		
	}
	@Override
	public void abstractMethod() {
		System.out.println("Implementation of the abstract method");
	}
}
```
# Interface

A Java Interface is like a normal class, the difference is that the Interface only has the signature of the methods it can't contain an implementation of none of it's methods. An Interface's variables can be accesed just like if it where a static variable of a normal class.

## Implementing an Interface

Before an Interface can be used it must be implemented in a Java class. The class that implements the Interface must implement all the interface's methods that has been declared and they must have the same signature that was defined in the Interface declaration. 

The class doesn't need to declare the Interface's variables. When instanciating an Interface it has the Interface type but it is created with the implementation type. 

A instance of a Java Interface can't be created by itself, an instance of some of the classes that implementats the interface must be created and use this as a reference of the Interface.

A Java class can implement multiple Interfaces and it must implement all the methods from all the interfaces, when a class that implements multiple Interfaces is instantiated the type could be any of the Interfaces that it implements and the creation type is the class implementation type.

### Interface Declaration
``` java
public interface Moviles{
	//This makes no sense is just an example
	public static String Hello = "Hello";
	public void helloWorld();	
}
```
### Interface Single Implementation
``` java
public class SingleImplementation implements Moviles{
	//Method Implementation
	@Override
	public void helloWorld() {
		//Accesing to the variable from the interface
		System.out.println(Moviles.Hello + " This is Lab1");
		//Accesing to the variable from the implementation		
		System.out.println(SingleImplementation.Hello + " This is Lab1");
	}
}
```

### Interface Multiple Implementation
``` java
public class MultipleImplementation implements Moviles, Moviles2 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Instance with Moviles type, only have access to Moviles methods
		Moviles instance1 = new MultipleImplementation();
		instance1.helloWorld();
		// Instance with Moviles2 type, only have access to Moviles2 methods
		Moviles2 instance2 = new MultipleImplementation();
		instance2.MultipleInterfaces("This is the second instance with the second type");
		// Instance with implementation class type
		MultipleImplementation instance3 = new MultipleImplementation();
		instance3.helloWorld();
		instance3.MultipleInterfaces("This instance has access to all the methods");
	}

	// Method from Moviles2 Interface
	@Override
	public void MultipleInterfaces(String s) {
		System.out.println(s);
	}

	// Method from Moviles Interface
	@Override
	public void helloWorld() {
		System.out.println("The type of the instance could be of any of the interfaces that it implements");
	}
}


```
# Static Field

A static field belongs to the class, no matter how many instances of the class you create there will only exist one field and it is the same no matter from which object is being accesed. In the code examples above there is a static field defined in the interface, this field will be the same for all the classes that implements this interface, as the comment says it makes no sense making an static field inside an interface. 
### Static field declaration
``` java
	//This makes no sense is just an example
	public static String Hello = "Hello";
```
