# Question 5

5. Inheritance, overloading and overcharge. The Geometric library:
	+ Create a GeometricFigure, Circle, Rectangular and Square
	classes. All figures have a name and a description so use
	Inheritance to avoid code repetition.
	+ Circle contains the properties ratio and pi value,
	rectangule contains the properties height and width and Square
	has the property edge for each side.
	+ The GeometricFigure class should be abstract and contain
	abstract methods caclulateArea and calculatePerimeter that each
	class needs to override and implement.
	+ Overload circle caclulateArea method to receive a given
	pi value to calculate the area instead of using an internal
	field of the class.
