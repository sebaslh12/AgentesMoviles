# Question 3

Performance test. Create unit test comparison and attach
report output for 100, 1000, 100000 operations. Explain briefly
each data structure implementation characteristics.
1. Evaluate Insert, Remove and get element by index operations
    + ArrayList
    + LinkedList
    + Vector
2. Evaluate get, put and remove operations for:
    + HashMap
    + LinkedHashMap

# Solution

IndexOperators class contains Arraylist, LinkedList and Vector. A method Insert, Remove and Get element by index for these structures.
IndexOperatorsTest has the test for each method in each structure.

Maps class contains HashMap and LinkedList. A method Put, Remove and Get element for these structures.
 MapsTest has the test for each one method in each structure.
